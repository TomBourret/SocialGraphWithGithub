##SocialGraphWithGithub

This version has only been tested on firefox.
You must enter your github username and password to avoid the API rate limit. Click on authenticate to start the graph (it should appear below the form; if not, click once in the area below).

In the graph, blue nodes are users, orange nodes are repositories and green nodes are oragnizations. The central blue node is "mbostock" (by default, didn't added the possibility to choose it before the deadline...)

I'm sorry for the ridiculous work I give, I feel really bad about it, but some other projects took me much more time than I thought, and I didn't achieve to organize myself correctly...
